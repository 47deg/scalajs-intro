<h1 id="letstalkaboutjavascriptasplatform">Let&#8217;s talk about Javascript as platform</h1>

<p>The platform has some very nice properties that make it a good target for application developers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zero-install distribution: just go to a URL and have the application downloaded and ready to use.</li>
</ul>
<!-- En contraposición a la tediosa tarea de poner en marcha apps desarrolladas en otras tecnologías -->

<ul>
  <li>Hyperlinks: being able to link to a particular page or item within a web app is a feature other platforms lack.</li>
</ul>
<!--Desktop applications generally do not talk to each other at all.-->

<ul>
  <li>Sandboxed security: you can be sure that once you close the page, they&#8217;re gone.</li>
</ul>
