<h1>Shared code Server-Client</h1>

<!--<ul>-->
  <!--<li>Traditionally the client-side code and server-side code has been written in separate languages</li>-->
  <!--<li>Algorithms are often implemented twice</li>-->
  <!--<li>Abusive Ajax calls to centralize the logic</li>-->
  <!--<li>What about Node.js? Yes... but not. "Write everything twice to write everything in Javascript"</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

<p>With Scala.js, you can utilize the same libraries you use writing your Scala servers when writing your Scala web clients!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not having to find two libraries to do a particular common task</li>
  <li>Not needing to implement the same algorithms twice</li>
  <li>Avoid duplicating logic between the client and server</li>
</ul>

<!--<p>Scala.js provides an alternative to this dilemma. With Scala.js, you can utilize the same libraries you use writing your Scala servers when writing your Scala web clients!</p>-->

<!--<ul>-->
  <!--<li>Not having to find two libraries to do a particular common task</li>-->
  <!--<li>Not having to re-learn two different ways of doing the exact same thing</li>-->
  <!--<li>Not needing to implement the same algorithms twice, for the times you can&#8217;t find a good library to do what you want</li>-->
  <!--<li>Not having to debug problems caused by subtle differences in the two implementations</li>-->
  <!--<li>Not having to resort to awkward Ajax-calls or pre-computation to avoid duplicating logic between the client and server</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->
