<h1 id="nonshared-codedrawbacks">Shared code Server-Client</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Traditionally the client-side code and server-side code has been written in separate languages</li>
  <li>Algorithms are often implemented twice</li>
  <li>Abusive Ajax calls to centralize the logic</li>
  <li>What about Node.js? Yes... but not. "Write everything twice to write everything in Javascript"</li>
</ul>

<p>With Scala.js, you can utilize the same libraries you use writing your Scala servers when writing your Scala web clients!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not having to find two libraries to do a particular common task</li>
  <li>Not needing to implement the same algorithms twice</li>
  <li>Avoid duplicating logic between the client and server</li>
</ul>
