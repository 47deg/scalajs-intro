<h1 id="nonshared-codedrawbacks">Non shared-code drawbacks</h1>

<ul>
  <li><p>Traditionally the client-side code and server-side code has been written in separate languages</p></li>
  <li><p>Server: PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, etc. | Client: Javascript</p></li>
</ul>
<!--- This means that algorithms were often implemented twice, constants copied-&-pasted, or awkward Ajax calls are made in an attempt to centralize the logic in one place (the server) -->

<ul>
  <li>What about Node.js? Yes you can re-use the same code on the server as you can on the client. But now we have the problems of Javascript in the server.</li>
</ul>
<!--"Write everything twice" to "Write everything twice, or write everything in Javascript"-->
