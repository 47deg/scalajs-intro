<h1 id="thebenefitsofshared-code">The benefits of shared-code</h1>

<p>Scala.js provides an alternative to this dilemma. With Scala.js, you can utilize the same libraries you use writing your Scala servers when writing your Scala web clients!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not having to find two libraries to do a particular common task</li>
  <li>Not having to re-learn two different ways of doing the exact same thing</li>
  <li>Not needing to implement the same algorithms twice, for the times you can&#8217;t find a good library to do what you want</li>
  <li>Not having to debug problems caused by subtle differences in the two implementations</li>
  <li>Not having to resort to awkward Ajax-calls or pre-computation to avoid duplicating logic between the client and server</li>
</ul>
